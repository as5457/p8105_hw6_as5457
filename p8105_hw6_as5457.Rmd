#Problem 1

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Modifiy victim_race to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category. Be sure that  victim_age is numeric.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
homicide_data = read_csv("./homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

```{r}
homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         solved = as.numeric (disposition == "Closed by arrest"))
```
